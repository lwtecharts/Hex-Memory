# Hex, Memory, Images

1. What is the largest number you can store in a byte? (answer in decimal form). Jot the answer down on a piece of scratch paper.

2. How does this relate to how you describe colors in P5, Processing, or another image-based software? (talk about the answer with the person sitting next to you).

3. Use the tool [here](http://cs.ucls.uchicago.edu/~bfranke/codeDotOrg/Pixelation/Pixelation_v2.html) to encode a black and white image of your own design. Note that the first two bytes in the image bit stream represent the width and height (why are these needed?) 

Share the bit stream and image with your classmates using this file (add your name too so I can give you credit!)

Switch to the color version. Set the “bits per pixel” to 24. In this mode, for each pixel, the first byte represents the amount of red, the second byte the amount of green, and the third byte the amount of blue. 

To practice, recreate a few pixels of the image below (they don’t have to exactly match the colors in the picture. Hint: for shades of gray, try making the R, G, B values similar to each other). Suggestion: use a decimal to binary convertor!

Example:
00000011 ← width
00000001 ← height
00000000  ← amount of red
11111111  ← amount of green			           
11111111  ← amount of blue			
00000000
11111111
00001111
11111111
11111111
00001111
Use this base conversion Snap block to convert the following numbers from decimal to hexadecimal (jot the answers down on a piece of scratch paper):
		10
		82
		200
255
Switch to “hex mode” in the color editor. In this mode, each byte is represented by two hexadecimal digits (1 nibble, or half byte, maps to 1 hex digit). This mode matches the way colors for the web are specified! So you can use a web color picker to choose colors. Use hex mode to design a small icon for yourself. Save the bit stream under your name here.

Homework: Finish saving both of your images to the shared doc for credit.
Then, save to your shared folder two different photos that you like (not photos off the internet, but ones which you or someone you know has taken and which you have permission to use). You will be “hacking” the pixels of these images next class.
Finally, install a hex editor on your computer and open it to make sure it runs. Here’s one for Mac, Windows, Linux.
