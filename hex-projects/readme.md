To add your project to the folder, follow these steps:

1. Create a new file and call it YourName.md
2. Paste the bit stream (the 1s and 0s) into Github's online text editor.
3. Github .md files use a language called Markdown. Follow the instructions on the [Markdown cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#images) to add your image to your file.
